# Limits of expression
Let's talk about artistic expression a bit.
What transforms a working person into an expressive being that shines and dances with flamingo feathers and diamonds? Is it still the same person - is what they are doing right now real, or is it a mask, is it fake?
Where is the boundary of expression, where we stop believing the expressed emotions and devaluate any further attempts into "that's just a play", no matter how hard further the try?
Is it not enough to be just a person anymore, and one that is named "a performance artist" should exaggerate and sometimes even fake their emotions just to be heard?
Would there be someone, or at least a machine, that will be willing to interact with you and even understand you when you are just being self?
Shouldn't the response from that machine which reads unintended gestures caused by unintended emotions be a more precise and clean mirror then any other intentionally decorated and bounded, constrained by traditional set of movements performance of a Zoauli dancer?
Artist exaggerates their emotions, while audience constraints theirs in return to become an observer. Some of us get very used to the observer constraint, and it would be nice to have an additional way of exploring them.
