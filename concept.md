# Introduction of concept

I'm interested in exploring interactive environments. My current focus is generative sound scapes.

Human was pushed from or walked out from natural habitat into an artificial world. Unfortunately, all the objects in the artificial world were build to serve us - the don't possess free will, and thus are not potent to surprise it's owner. Human environments are boring, static, predictable and utilitarian. Modern art would be much more interesting if were more interactive, so making it this way is a share goal among new generation artistic communities.

Instead of crafting interactive virtual reality, I would like to explore crafting sophisticated physical object, and concentrate on building smart interactive devices.

# Concept
In this exploration of interactive machines I'd like to propose a machine that generates sound scapes based on detected realtime human movements.

# Reason
- bringing awareness of responsibility through meditation on a responsive environment - sound and light
- rethinking place of machines in our lives
- discovering new forms of human to machine interaction
- deep learning movement patterns of human groups 
- exploring possibility of self trained machines, that have different personality based on previous experience


# Interdisciplinary
- assembly of a continuous unsupervised learning machine, close to a general purpose AI

# Positioning
- conceptual interior design
- audio visual installation
- augmented audio performance

# Relevance
Rediscovering machine's role in human lives. Can sophisticated machines be of use without being connected to global network, and sharing data with the outside world, but instead become personally modified diverse like pets.

Can modern machines be as real as any other object, without dragging us into addictive world of online social networks.

Are there other ways of consturctively interacting with machines besides screens and voice commands?

Can machine adapt to us based on our mood and current activity?
