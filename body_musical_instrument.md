Can a physical body itself be a musical instrument, without a need of automating fingers and breath around a specific musical instrument of art, or learning any musical theory, or anything at all?
Those of us who did learn how to play a fiscal instrument are often still limited to a known set of plays that they can play.
Becoming a musical composer is a much more rare case even among those who know how to play. But does it mean that they are the only ones who have what to express musically?
The Mirror name is probably resulted in my mystical fear of mirrors. I would be happy not to look into any more ever.
How can I looking at the mirror try to evaluate what other people will see in me, will like in me?
I think it's quite fine not to like myself in a mirror,  but be adored by a beautiful lady.
I'm not actually supposed to look at myself and like myself by the rule of nature.
A dancing male bird is not supposed to like itself, but is supposed to be liked by a female bird.
I can imagine if a dancing bird were shown his reflection in a mirror, it would be full of anger rather than admiration - to see a male bird dancing in front of him must be quite unpleasant.
On the other hand it is in human nature to look for ways of seeing self reflection - in water, in a metal plate, in a window, in a mirror, observe ourselves in a video, photo picture or voice recording and share it with someone else of our else.

It is probably not possible yet to answer DJ Shadow's question "How does your soul look like?", but it might be possible to tell in a very abstract way how it may sound like even for those who are not trained to and are not willing to make music as a conscious act. Yet, a mirror shows reflection whether you like it or not, objectively, as a utility.

The hypothesis of this experiment s that nothing else is needed than the body itself to be a musical instrument. Body is already an expressive medium and requires no additional knowledge it order to be expressive, so our job is to build a framework around it in a humanitarian way, opposed to training ourselves to fit around a specific instrument.
