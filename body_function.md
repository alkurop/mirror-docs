# Body Function.
Technology is all around us. The more we have it, the more it substitutes real world. It became easier to communicate with a machine than with the world, and with each other through a machine.
Communication with a machine brought along a dystopian feeling of surreality and lack of spirituality.
Human body seems now redundant in this process. We don't need to run, climb or carry heavy stuff to survive in our shell. With so much remote work since covid, some of us barely even need to walk outside. 
We have food delivery, magnetic brain to computer interface is in early stages, children can be implanted artificially, and cloning them or growing outside of the body is just around the corner. Many artists already spoke about it, my favourite example is the Alien series.
What do we need our body for? It requires a lot of effort to maintain - excursive it, feed it, heal it, experience pain and fix it, but can it be used for anything?
Pleasure can also be delivered chemically - while writing this note I'm watching an older couple having beers together. They don't need their body for sex anymore, Sweets, drugs, alcohol, tobacco - this is all artificial and becomes cleaner and safer with time.
