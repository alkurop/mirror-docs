# Reason for this project to exist is to explore:
- body as a musical instrument
- audio interior design
- ordinary dance that we exhibit daily being possessed by the subconscious. 
- a way of learning out subconscious, see it in a mirror
- interaction between humans - will there be noticed similar movement patterns?
- how will future of human to machine interaction look like, will it be able to notice our emotions?
