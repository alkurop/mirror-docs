# Sound pollution / generative sound

We are taking care of our cities by planning nice architecture, environments with parks and lakes. We disallow large advertisement to keep out disturbing visuals, we conquer air pollution by planting trees and banning diesel engines in city area. 

We also decorate. We decorate smell with aroma and air fresheners, we decorate light with lamps and windows, glass walls and blinds.

Among all decorate ourselves with clothes, haircuts, perfumes and makeup.
We also filter sounds and protect ourselves from noisy autobahns and trains.

We've discovered many ways to visually and sensually decorate both internal and external habitat, but this picture seems incomplete without sound decoration.

Is there a way for us to have a decorative sound, that can interact with environment, and be generated in real time according to it?
Can "Music for Airports" be generated not just for airpots, but for any other reasonable context?
