# Use Cases


Such a system has multiple use cases not limited by my imaginations, but at very least:
1. Installed in a room as a stand alone exhibition to explore human and machine interaction. 
2. Installed in a visually design room as a part of a futuristic interior design set up.
3. Can be distributed as a universal environmental sound generative system for general audience / consumer product
4. Can be used in a collaboration mode, where a musical performance is given by humans, while audience is interactively responding, jamming along with artist via the Mirror interface.

There are some technical step required to convert the current prototype into a consumer ready prototype - MVP to a mass market product scale up.

The scale up require hiding computational and logical tasks behind a web site interface. Minimum set up will then require, to open a web site, start camera, and connect the web site's Midi output to Ableton.
