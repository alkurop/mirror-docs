### Project magenta
[url](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/blog)
This is an amazing place with lots of interesting projects

It uses Node JS with Electron UI to run Tensorflow.js and Magenta.js. The intermediate layer is Max for Live. 

Magenta community is [here](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/community)


Their approach is too different from mine.
The cool thing is that they can run Tensorflow without installing drivers.

**continue** - continue midi patter, using RNN network
**generate** - creates pattern on its own
**interpolate** - cross fades between two patterns
**groove** - works same as basic ableton groove (i think)

### Worth trying to play with it, make some music, not sure it will fit within Mirror
