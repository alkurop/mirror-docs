Zoauli dancers a believed to be possessed by spirits while they dance. Musical band are creating company to follow the dancer with sound.
They replicate every movement with beats, strings and flutes.

We here have a subconscious part of the dancer exposed through a chain of medium agents to the final audience, not only dancer's voice, but also dancer to musician interaction. Could we possibly create something similar?
Let's agree that when a fiscal band is playing their concert, musicians have a much deeper level of interaction with each other, then with the any audience, with or without it.
Same may be said about the dancer to dancer, dancer to musician vs dancer to audience interactions.
Zoauli dance is an intentional of self expression. But what about other movements? Some of us was slower, some - faster, some keep hands in their pockets, while others make vivid gestures while talking to others. 
Many if not all of these movements considering not just intention but also rhythm and aptitude have deeply subconscious roots.
While zoauli dancer is considered to be possessed by the ancient spirit only while he's dancing in a traditional hypnotic state, can be be said that we are in a way also being controlled by spirits, that control our lives, 
when we are curling our hair, playing with a pen, or making wide Italian gestures during a conversation?
What music could accompany our ordinary daily dance?
