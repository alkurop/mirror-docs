# Hypothesis

There are some fairly interesting questions that project Mirror is supposed to answer.
1. Can a machine replace a live band?
2. Can a machine augment a live band?
3. Can there be reached a noticeable variation of sound, depending on the context
- single body
- multiple bodies
- resting bodies
- walking bodies
- talking bodies
4. Is there still enough artistic space for a sound designer within the mirror system, how will the workflow look like?
5. Can sound produced by the Mirror machine make people want to dance?
6. Can such a device be install in a non-artistic environment to perform ambient function, i.e. cafe, library, metro station, school
7. Is it reasonable to have an augmented musical experience?
8. Can this device be informative, as an actual mirror is. Will the sound scape produced be valuable as an indicator of emotional state, mood of the audience.
