There are some additional ideas to explore beyond and above the current phase:
1. How could multiple machine of this kind exchange data with one another
2. What also beyond sound could they control 
- light
- humidity
- physical objects
- ventilators

3. Machine works caching data from previous frames. Does this cache has same origin as human memory? 
4. Can there be events that are delivered into the long term memory and define mood of a specific machine compared to other ones?
5. This type of memory is going to be stored on a hard drive and persisted between performances - something to do at a later stage.
6. Now machine will need up to 10 minutes to warm up, gathering data, to figure out what's going on before it can work in full throttle
